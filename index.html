        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Heat the oil in a large pan and cook the onion for 8-10 mins until starting to caramelise (or for longer if you have time – the sweeter the better). Add the garlic for the final 2 mins of cooking time.
</p><br>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tip in the mixed veg, tomatoes, capers and raisins. Season well and simmer, uncovered, for 10 mins, or until you have a rich sauce.
</p><br>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Meanwhile, boil the kettle. Pour the kettleful of water into a large pan with a little salt and bring back to the boil. Add the pasta and cook until tender with a little bite, then drain, reserving some of the pasta water. Tip the pasta into the sauce, adding a splash of pasta water if it needs loosening. Scatter with the basil leaves and parmesan, if you like, and serve straight from the pan

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Cook the gnocchi in a large pan of lightly salted, boiling water. Drain and reserve 200ml of the cooking water.
</p><br>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Heat the butter in a large frying pan. Add the gnocchi, cheese and pepper as well as 150ml of the cooking water, raise the heat a little and stir vigorously until melted and the gnocchi is well coated. Pour in more of the reserved water if you like it saucier. Season with a little salt. Transfer the gnocchi to bowls and serve with a mixed salad, if you like.
